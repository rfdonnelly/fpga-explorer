== GUI

A modern multi-language Tk tutorial that covers using Python + Tk via Tkinter.

* Cons
** Cannot scroll widgets that contain widgets.
E.g. A view containing multiple register detail views.
There may be a hack that uses a `Canvas`.
Not sure this is neeed.
We may end up only showing a single register detail view at a time.
*** Possible solution: https://blog.teclado.com/tkinter-scrollable-frames[Scrollable Frames in Tkinter]
*** Possible solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16188420/tkinter-scrollbar-for-frame[Tkinter scrollbar for frame]
** Cannot easily rotate label text.
Must implement custom label using a `Canvas`.
*** Solved: https://github.com/rfdonnelly/fpga-explorer/blob/63ff29359c5458bbcdd1aa0435056539221ec3c0/protos/tkgui/main.pyw#L175-L198[63ff293]
** Cannot easily dock/undock views.
There is some support in the form of `wm manage` and `wm forget` but very cumbersome.
Difficult to hide/show views.
Views limited to fixed positions using `Panedwindow`.
*** Partial prototype: https://github.com/rfdonnelly/fpga-explorer/blob/63ff29359c5458bbcdd1aa0435056539221ec3c0/protos/tkgui/main.pyw#L521-L529[63ff293]
* Pros
** Bundled with Python for easy distribution
** IDLE (Python REPL/editor/debugged) also uses Tk.
Can integrate some of IDLE into app?
** Basics are pretty easy once you get past the layout stuff.

== Installer

https://www.pyinstaller.org/[PyInstaller]::
Create a single standalone binary to simplify distribution.
Does not actually install application but might be used as an intermediate step to creating an installer using something like Inno Setup.

https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php[Inno Setup]::
A free installer for Windows programs.
Installs, creates shortcuts, etc.

== Scripting

=== TCL Scripting

Tkinter provides access to the embedded TCL interpreter.
Python methods can be called from TCL by creating TCL commands that call Python methods.

[source,python]
----
import tkinter

tcl = Tcl()

def hello_from(source):
    print(f"hello from {source}")

tcl.tk.createcommand("hello_from", hello_from)

hello_from("python")
tcl.tk.eval("hello_from tcl")
